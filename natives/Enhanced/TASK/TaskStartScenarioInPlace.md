unkDelay - Usually 0 or -1, doesn't seem to have any effect. Might be a delay between sequences.
playEnterAnim - Plays the "Enter" anim if true, otherwise plays the "Exit" anim. Scenarios that don't have any "Enter" anims won't play if this is set to true.

From "am_hold_up.ysc.c4" at line 339:

TASK::TASK_START_SCENARIO_IN_PLACE(NETWORK::NET_TO_PED(l_8D._f4), sub_adf(), 0, 1);

I'm unsure of what the last two parameters are, however sub_adf() randomly returns 1 of 3 scenarios, those being:
WORLD_HUMAN_SMOKING
WORLD_HUMAN_HANG_OUT_STREET
WORLD_HUMAN_STAND_MOBILE

This makes sense, as these are what I commonly see when going by a liquor store.
