No description available.

### Parameters
* Vehicle vehicle

### Return Value
* void

* Build: 811
* Disables collision for this vehicle (maybe it also supports other entities, not sure).
Only world/building/fixed world objects will have their collisions disabled, props, peds, or any other entity still collides with the vehicle.

Not sure if there is a native (and if so, which one) that resets the collisions.
