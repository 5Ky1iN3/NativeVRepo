# _FIND_SPAWN_COORDINATES_FOR_HELI

No description available.

### Parameters
* Ped ped

### Return Value
* Vector3

### Notes
* Build: 811
* Native is significantly more complicated than simply generating a random vector & length.
The 'point' is either 400.0 or 250.0 units away from the Ped's current coordinates; and paths into functions like rage::grcViewport___IsSphereVisible
