# _SET_DISABLE_HOVER_MODE_FLIGHT

--- ns: VEHICLE aliases: ["_SET_VEHICLE_HOVER_TRANSFORM_ACTIVE"] --- ## SET_DISABLE_HOVER_MODE_FLIGHT  // 0x2D55FE374D5FDB91 void SET_DISABLE_HOVER_MODE_FLIGHT(Vehicle vehicle, BOOL toggle);  Disables wings for `Deluxo` and `Oppressor MK II`. For the Deluxo, it retracts the wings immediately, preventing flight. For the Oppressor Mk II, the wings retract after landing and take-off is not possible, though it can still glide if launched into the air.   ## Parameters * **vehicle**: The vehicle to which the toggle will be applied. * **toggle**: Boolean parameter where setting `true` disables the vehicle's wings, preventing flight. Setting it to `false` allows the vehicle to fly as usual.  ## Examples -- In this case we are disabling the wings of the vehicle local vehicle = GetVehiclePedIsIn(PlayerPedId(), false) SetDisableHoverModeFlight(vehicle, true)  // In this case we are disabling the wings of the vehicle const vehicle = GetVehiclePedIsIn(PlayerPedId(), false); SetDisableHoverModeFlight(vehicle, true);  // In this case we are disabling the wings of the vehicle using static CitizenFX.Core.Native.API; Vehicle vehicle = GetVehiclePedIsIn(PlayerPedId(), false); SetDisableHoverModeFlight(vehicle, true);

### Parameters
* Vehicle vehicle
* BOOL toggle

### Return Value
* void

### Notes
* Build: 811
* Disables "wings" for some flying vehicles. Works only for oppressor _2_ and deluxo.
For deluxo it just immediately removes vehicle's "wings" and you will be not able to fly up.
For oppressor 2 it will remove wings right after you land. And you will not able to fly up anymore too.
But for opressor 2 you still can fly if you somehow get back in the air.
