# _SET_SPECIAL_FLIGHT_MODE_RATIO

--- ns: VEHICLE aliases: ["_SET_VEHICLE_HOVER_TRANSFORM_RATIO"] --- ## SET_SPECIAL_FLIGHT_MODE_RATIO  // 0xD138FA15C9776837 void SET_SPECIAL_FLIGHT_MODE_RATIO(Vehicle vehicle, float ratio);  Used alongside [`SET_SPECIAL_FLIGHT_MODE_TARGET_RATIO`](#_0x438B3D7CA026FE91), this function initiates hover transformation for vehicles with a hover mode, like the `Deluxo`, based on a specified ratio (0.0 to 1.0). Incorrect values can glitch the vehicle. Without pairing, vehicles revert to car mode. Ineffective on the `oppressor2`  ## Parameters * **vehicle**: The vehicle to which the ratio will be applied. * **ratio**: A value between 0.0 and 1.0 indicating the target state for the vehicle's hover mode transition. In decompiled scripts, a common usage is 0.75 - GetFrameTime(). Exceeding the maximum can cause the `Deluxo's` wheels to glitch, delaying their return to the initial position.  ## Examples -- In this case we are enabling the hover mode for the vehicle and initiates hover transformation. local vehicle = GetVehiclePedIsIn(PlayerPedId(), false) SetSpecialFlightModeRatio(vehicle, 0.75 - GetFrameTime()) SetVehicleHoverTransformPercentage(vehicle, 1.0)  // In this case we are enabling the hover mode for the vehicle and initiates hover transformation. const vehicle = GetVehiclePedIsIn(PlayerPedId(), false); SetSpecialFlightModeRatio(vehicle, 0.75 - GetFrameTime()); SetVehicleHoverTransformPercentage(vehicle, 1.0);  // In this case we are enabling the hover mode for the vehicle and initiates hover transformation. using static CitizenFX.Core.Native.API; Vehicle vehicle = GetVehiclePedIsIn(PlayerPedId(), false); SetSpecialFlightModeRatio(vehicle, 0.75f - GetFrameTime()); SetVehicleHoverTransformPercentage(vehicle, 1f);

### Parameters
* Vehicle vehicle
* float ratio

### Return Value
* void

### Notes
* Build: 811
* Used in conjunction with SET_SPECIAL_FLIGHT_MODE_TARGET_RATIO, in Rockstar's scripts. Using this will instantly transform the vehicle into hover mode starting from the given ratio (ranging from 0.0 to 1.0, values greater than 1.0 will put the vehicle into a glitched state.) If this is not used alongside SET_SPECIAL_FLIGHT_MODE_TARGET_RATIO, the vehicle will automatically transform back into car mode.

Usable only with the deluxo and other vehicles with deluxo-like hover mode toggle, modded or otherwise. Does nothing when used on oppressor2.

Example:
Ped playerPed = PLAYER::PLAYER_PED_ID();
Vehicle veh = PED::GET_VEHICLE_PED_IS_USING(playerPed);
VEHICLE::SET_SPECIAL_FLIGHT_MODE_RATIO(veh, 0.7f);
VEHICLE::SET_SPECIAL_FLIGHT_MODE_TARGET_RATIO(veh, 1.0f);
