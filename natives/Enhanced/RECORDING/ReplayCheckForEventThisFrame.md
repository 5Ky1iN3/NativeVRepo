No description available.

### Parameters
* const char* missionNameLabel
* Any p1

### Return Value
* void

### Notes
* Build: 811
* -This function appears to be deprecated/ unused. Tracing the call internally leads to a _nullsub -

first one seems to be a string of a mission name, second one seems to be a bool/toggle

p1 was always 0.
