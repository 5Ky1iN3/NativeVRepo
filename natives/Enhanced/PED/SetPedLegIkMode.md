--- ns: PED --- ## SET_PED_LEG_IK_MODE  // 0xC396F5B86FF9FEBD 0xFDDB042E void SET_PED_LEG_IK_MODE(Ped ped, int mode);  "IK" stands for "Inverse kinematics." I assume this has something to do with how the ped uses his legs to balance. In the scripts, the second parameter is always an int with a value of 2, 0, or sometimes 1  ## Parameters * **ped**: * **mode**:
