# _CREATE_CAM_WITH_PARAMS

--- ns: CAM --- ## CREATE_CAM_WITH_PARAMS  // 0xB51194800B257161 0x23B02F15 Cam CREATE_CAM_WITH_PARAMS(char* camName, float posX, float posY, float posZ, float rotX, float rotY, float rotZ, float fov, BOOL active, int rotationOrder);  Create a camera with the specified cam name/type, You can use `SET_CAM_` natives to manipulate the camera.  Take a look at [CREATE_CAM](#_0xC3981DCE61D9E13F) if you would like to see the available camera names.  ## Parameters * **camName**: A string representing the camera type, the game will convert the string into a joaat hash upon native execution. * **posX**: The x position of the camera (you can also send a vector3 instead of the bulk coordinates) * **posY**: The y position of the camera (you can also send a vector3 instead of the bulk coordinates) * **posZ**: The z position of the camera (you can also send a vector3 instead of the bulk coordinates) * **rotX**: The x rotation of the camera * **rotY**: The y rotation of the camera * **rotZ**: The z rotation of the camera * **fov**: The Field Of View of the camera, is the observable world that is seen * **active**: Set to true if you wish to make this new camera the active camera. * **rotationOrder**: The order of rotation, see [`GET_ENTITY_ROTATION`](#_0xAFBD61CC738D9EB9)  ## Return value A camera handle.   ## Examples local cam = CreateCamWithParams("DEFAULT_SCRIPTED_CAMERA", 561.3, 301.3, 63.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 90.0)  const cam = CreateCamWithParams("DEFAULT_SCRIPTED_CAMERA", 561.3, 301.3, 63.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 90.0);  int cam = CreateCamWithParams("DEFAULT_SCRIPTED_CAMERA", 561.3f, 301.3f, 63.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f, 90.0f);

### Parameters
* const char* camName
* float posX
* float posY
* float posZ
* float rotX
* float rotY
* float rotZ
* float fov
* BOOL p8
* int p9

### Return Value
* Cam

### Notes
* AP Hash: 0x0x23B02F15
* Build: 811
* camName is always set to "DEFAULT_SCRIPTED_CAMERA" in Rockstar's scripts.
------------
Camera names found in the b617d scripts:
"DEFAULT_ANIMATED_CAMERA"
"DEFAULT_SCRIPTED_CAMERA"
"DEFAULT_SCRIPTED_FLY_CAMERA"
"DEFAULT_SPLINE_CAMERA"
------------
Side Note: It seems p8 is basically to represent what would be the bool p1 within CREATE_CAM native. As well as the p9 since it's always 2 in scripts seems to represent what would be the last param within SET_CAM_ROT native which normally would be 2.
